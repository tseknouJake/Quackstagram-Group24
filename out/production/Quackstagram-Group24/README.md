# Quackstagram

## Description: 
Quackstagram is social media software that lets DACS students share images with each other.
It includes features like user profiles, images posting, likes, followers.
The core of this app revolves around letting users set up and personalize their profiles. 
Users sign up, log in, and add a personal touch with photos and bios, just like they would 
on Instagram. Once that's done, users can start sharing snapshots of their lives by uploading 
images with captions.
